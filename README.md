# General Coding, Learning, and Placement Resources
This repository is used for saving questions with solutions from Hackkerank, Coding Ninjas, and useful documents and links of CS concepts like OS, CN, DBMS, OOP along with ML & DSA for my personal use. Also contains a lot of free and extremely helpful resources I used to crack campus interviews and placements (for software roles).

TIP: Search for required resources be it coding questions/interview preparation/learning resource by searching repositories in GitHub or in Scribd website for related documents. LinkedIn posts from people working in top PBCs contain valuable advices, interview tips, and resources. Subscribe to their newsletters for helpful technical resources and industry tips.

## General Tips
Some general but underrated tips to crack campus placements (basically whatever you need to do to stand out to the recruiter among hundreds of competitors):
- In self intro/ tell me about yourself, it's good to start with your name, department and college, and latest CGPA. Followed by your top 3 strengths (pitch yourself to the interviewer as a solid candidate for hiring), short term and long term goals (optional), top skills and tech stack (try to tailor it to the job role and expected skill-set), top achievements in hackathons/ contests/ paper publications (highlight how your achievements are proof of your tech and soft skills), positions of responsibility (pitch your leadership and teamwork skills, be it your position in a club, event, or class committee), and if time permits brief your top projects and hobbies.
- Keep your self intro short and crisp, lasting 2-5 minutes. Ensure that your important highlights like achievements and skills (tech & soft) are spoken in the initial few minutes itself of your self intro because some interviewers might interrupt midway to start the interview soon.
- Keep your resume neat in PDF format and avoid columns, colorful look, pictures, graphs and visualizations, and unprofessional/ difficult to read font style and size. Do proper spacing between each section and sub-sections, make it easy to read.
- Resume should be only 1 page long, because most interviewers spend only few seconds reading it and hence might not go throught the 2nd page or just give a quick glance overall without reading it properly, so they might miss out focusing on important details. That'd be a disadvantage for you because you won't stand out to the recruiter as a potential candidate.
- Your resume should have your name, contact number, personal email, LinkedIn and GitHub profile links, and links to coding profiles like LeetCode and CodeChef if you have a good contest rating. Keep your personal email professional and easy to remember. Make sure that your resume is visible to all in view-only mode in case of submitting Google drive links to recruiters.
- Put skills section on top with proper sub-sections like programming languages: C, Python, databases: Oracle, MySQL, frameworks: Scikit, Pytorch, tools: Power BI, Tableau, others: machine learning, deep learning, etc.
- Ensure that your resume has education, skills, experience, projects, achievements, and certifications section. If resume still has space, you can include profile section on top and position of responsibility and hobbies and interests sections at the bottom of resume.
- Avoid vague descriptions in sections like projects, internships, and achievements in resume. For these sections, give a crisp 2-3 line description of what model/ application you've done to solve what problem along with quantitative accuracy and performance metrics. Write the tech stack used for each in a separate line below.
- Spell check everything in resume thoroughly, and avoid repeating words and unnecessary details. Only include top 3-4 projects, achievements, and certifications.
- Add links to your certificates, profiles, projects, etc in your resume and ensure that all links are accessible to anyone for viewing.
- Be confident in interviews and practice speaking out loud in front of the mirror everyday so that you don't fumble or get nervous in front of the interviewer. Speak with clarity and loudness, keep eye contact, sit straight, and use body language and hand movements when communicating.
- Don't give off negative impression by being distracted, having poor body posture, and fidgeting or sitting with arms crossed in front of the interviewer.
- Smile when greeting interviewer and have a focused expression throughout the interview. Smile occassionally, but not too much or too long as it'll give a bad impression to interviewer that you're not being serious. Learn to control facial expressions when talking by practicing in front of the mirror.
- When interviewer gives handshake, do it firmly with confidence and smile. Otherwise you'll come off as arrogant and overconfident or nervous and scared depending on how you do it.
- Always research the company beforehand and ask meaningful questions to the interviewer at the end of each interview round to show your interest in the company and job role being offered. Never leave the interview without asking questions at end.
- Research and know the key people (like founder, CEO, CTO, etc) in the company, the domains where the company works on, it's products/ services offered, it's competitors, etc.
- When explaining projects and internships, make it brief and state the problem statement, reason for choosing the project, how you solved the problem, tech stack used, and it's impact and performance metrics. Know to explain it's future work, challenges faced and how you overcame them, etc if interviewer asks.
